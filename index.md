Most if not all fields of research rely on computers and an increasing number of researchers employ computational methods to collect or analyze data. Coding is found more and more often as a tool in the researcher’s toolbox. However, knowing how to program is just one piece of the puzzle. To develop robust computational solutions that are sustainable, maintainable, and trustworthy requires additional skills and knowledge. This course will give an overview of technologies, best practices, and processes that every coding researcher should be aware of and employ in their programming work. Students will learn how to develop maintainable code, get hands-on experiences with tools that can help improve code quality and performance, and become familiar with software development best practices.        

This class is taught by Julia Damerow.
